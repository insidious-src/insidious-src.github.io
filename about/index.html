<p>My passion with computers started with a local internet club.
   I had no idea how all that stuff worked but wanted to figure it out.
   Ever since my primary focus has been in that direction.</p>

<p><i class="icon fa-code"></i> In 2008 I started making custom websites from scratch.
   Soon after my personal computer science teacher noticed my rapid progress and decided to make me a job offer.
   I was doing mostly web designs and Joomla extensions.
   I did a couple of jobs in Visual Basic, as well.</p>

<i class="icon fa-graduation-cap"></i> In 2010 I graduated The English High School “Geo Milev” located in Burgas.</p>

<span><i class="icon fa-calendar-plus-o"></i> Since 2012 I’ve been involved in several big projects:</span>
<ul>
    <li>Simulation/Game Engine in C++ - Neuron</li>
    <li>C++ Unified Abstraction Library - Qt replacement utilizing OpenCL & OpenGL (eventually Vulkan) +
  Layered Network Protocols</li>
    <li>Integrated Development Environment in C++</li>
