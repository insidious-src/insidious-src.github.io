# Overview
----

#### List of What You Can Modify
* textures   - using mk4strip
* 3d models  - using alter3d + asefix
* sounds     - using mk4strip & automated audio converter
* game logic - using hex injection tool + a hex map for the known offsets
* installer  - using NSIS

#### asefix
>A little tool for **.ase 3d models audit**,
>fixing format **compatibility issues** with mk4 &
>**automatic .hra generation**

***Why is the tool necessary?***
The creator of mk4strip presented _very little information_ about the correct way to format _.ase 3d models_, how to _generate .hra files_ & _bone structure_. As a result if _stripe3d_ didn't crash in the process, it produced a completely _messed up .geo file_.

#### injection
>hex injection tool that **modifies mk4.exe offsets** to string pointers & **intercepts win32 api calls**

## About

#### How To
>The whole modding process is built around CMake.
>It **automates** everything with the help of a few **configuration files**.
>If something is missing or not used the propper way while building your modification, you will be informed with a meaningful explanation and pointed in the right direction.
